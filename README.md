The most complicated hello world

The code in HelloWorld.bf has been written in brainfuck, take your time understanding it.
Also, I have included a brainfuck interpreter made in python (https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Brainfuck)
to ease the pain of installing some brainfuck compiler.

###Instructions to run the code

1 - Make sure Python 3+ is installed and is added to PATH

2 - Run "python interpreter.py HelloWorld.bf"
